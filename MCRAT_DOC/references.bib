Based on the observations made by the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager on board AstroSat, here we report the most conclusive evidence to date of (i) high linear polarization ( detection), and (ii) variation of polarization angle with time, occurring twice during the rise and decay phase of the burst at 3.5σ and 3.1σ detections, respectively. All confidence levels are reported for two parameters of interest. These observations strongly suggest synchrotron radiation produced in magnetic field lines that are highly ordered on angular scales of 1/Γ, where Γ is the Lorentz factor of the outflow.},

@article{Gill_Polarization,
	Abstract = {{Despite being hard to measure, GRB prompt gamma-ray emission polarization is a valuable probe of the dominant emission mechanism and the GRB outflow's composition and angular structure. During the prompt emission the GRB outflow is ultrarelativistic with Lorentz factors Γ ≫ 1. We describe in detail the linear polarization properties of various emission mechanisms: synchrotron radiation from different magnetic field structures (ordered: toroidal Btor or radial B∥, and random: normal to the radial direction B⊥), Compton drag, and photospheric emission. We calculate the polarization for different GRB jet angular structures (e.g. top-hat, Gaussian, power law) and viewing angles θobs. Synchrotron with B⊥ can produce large polarizations, up to \\$25\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\lesssim \\Pi \\lesssim 45\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$, for a top-hat jet but only for lines of sight just outside (θobs − θj ∼ 1/Γ) the jet's sharp edge at θ = θj. The same also holds for Compton drag, albeit with a slightly higher overall Π. Moreover, we demonstrate how Γ-variations during the GRB or smoother jet edges (on angular scales ≳ 0.5/Γ) would significantly reduce Π. We construct a semi-analytic model for non-dissipative photospheric emission from structured jets. Such emission can produce up to \\$\\Pi \\lesssim 15\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ with reasonably high fluences, but this requires steep gradients in Γ(θ). A polarization of \\$50\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\lesssim \\Pi \\lesssim 65\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ can robustly be produced only by synchrotron emission from a transverse magnetic field ordered on angles ≳ 1/Γ around our line of sight (like a global toroidal field, Btor, for 1/Γ \\&lt; θobs \\&lt; θj). Therefore, such a model would be strongly favoured even by a single secure measurement within this range. We find that such a model would also be favoured if \\$\\Pi \\gtrsim 20\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ is measured in most GRBs within a large enough sample, by deriving the polarization distribution for our different emission and jet models.}},

@article{ICMART_Zhang_2010,
	Abstract = {The recent Fermi observation of GRB 080916C shows that the bright photosphere emission associated with a putative fireball is missing, which suggests that the central engine likely launches a Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) outflow. We propose a model of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission in the PFD regime, namely, the Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. It is envisaged that the GRB central engine launches an intermittent, magnetically dominated wind, and that in the GRB emission region, the ejecta is still moderately magnetized (e.g., 1 ≲ σ ≲ 100). Similar to the internal shock (IS) model, the mini-shells interact internally at the radius R
            IS ∼ Γ2
            cΔt. Most of these early collisions, however, have little energy dissipation, but serve to distort the ordered magnetic field lines entrained in the ejecta. At a certain point, the distortion of magnetic field configuration reaches the critical condition to allow fast reconnection seeds to occur, which induce relativistic MHD turbulence in the interaction regions. The turbulence further distorts field lines easing additional magnetic reconnections, resulting in a runway release of the stored magnetic field energy (an ICMART event). Particles are accelerated either directly in the reconnection zone, or stochastically in the turbulent regions, which radiate synchrotron photons that power the observed gamma rays. Each ICMART event corresponds to a broad pulse in the GRB light curve, and a GRB is composed of multiple ICMART events. This model retains the merits of IS and other models, but may overcome several difficulties/issues faced by the IS model (e.g., low efficiency, fast cooling, electron number excess, Amati/Yonetoku relation inconsistency, and missing bright photosphere). Within this model, the observed GRB variability timescales could have two components, one slow component associated with the central engine time history, and another fast component associated with relativistic magnetic turbulence in the emission region. The model predicts a decrease of gamma-ray polarization degree and Ep
             in each ICMART event (broad pulse) during the prompt GRB phase, as well as a moderately magnetized external reverse shock. The model may be applied to the GRBs that have time-resolved, featureless Band-function spectra, such as GRB 080916C and most GRBs detected by Fermi LAT.},

@article{grb_collapsar_model,
	Abstract = {We continue our study of the possible production of supernovae and a variety of high-energy transients by black hole formation in massive stars endowed with rotation: the "collapsar model." The black hole may form either promptly, since a successful outgoing shock fails to be launched by the collapsed iron core (collapsar Type I), or, in a mild explosion, by fallback (collapsar Type II). In the latter case, the inner layers of the star initially move outward but lack adequate momentum to eject all the matter exterior to the young neutron star. Over a period of minutes to hours, ~0.1-5 M ☉ falls back onto the collapsed remnant, turning it into a black hole and establishing an accretion disk. The accretion rate, ~0.001-0.01 M ☉ s -1 , is inadequate to produce a jet mediated by neutrino annihilation but is similar to what has been invoked in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This fallback is modeled in detail for two 25 M ☉ progenitors using two different one-dimensional hydrodynamics codes, one Lagrangian and one Eulerian. The production and consequences of jets are then explored in both sorts of collapsars. Justification is given for assuming that the jet power is a constant times the mass accretion rate, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/550/1/410/img1.gif] {img1.gif} c 2 , and the consequences of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} = 0.001 and 0.01 are explored. Adopting an initial collimation half-angle of 10$\,^{\circ}$, the opening of the jet as it propagates through the exploding star is strongly influenced not only by the jet's kinetic energy but also by its initial pressure and the stellar structure. Cold jets tend to stay collimated and become even more so, sometimes having an angle of only a few degrees when they reach the surface. Jets having higher internal pressure than the stellar material through which they pass, or less initial collimation, spread out and tend to make energetic, asymmetric supernovae accompanied, in helium stars, by weak GRBs. SN 1998bw may have been such an event, and other events having energies between that of ordinary GRBs and GRB 980425 await discovery. In supergiant stars, shock breakout also produces bright X-ray transients that might be a diagnostic of the model, but even the most powerful jets (equivalent isotropic energy 10 54 ergs) will not produce a GRB in a red supergiant. For such Type II supernovae the limiting Lorentz factor is Γ ≈ 2. Type II collapsars should be more frequent than Type I and may power the most common form of gamma-ray transient in the universe. However, the GRBs seen by BATSE are, for the most part, too brief to be Type II collapsars. Those are still attributed to prompt black hole formation. Even there though, the diverse energies and time structure reflect chiefly the viewing angle and the variable collimation of the jet inside the star, not a highly variable "central engine." Indeed, collapsar-induced transients may all have a common total energy in the range 10 51 -10 52 ergs.},

@article{GW_NS_merger,
	Abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory . The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn1.gif] {$5.0\times {10}^{-8}$} . We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use the observed time delay of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn2.gif] {$(+1.74\pm 0.05)\,{\rm{s}}$} between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn3.gif] {$-3\times {10}^{-15}$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn4.gif] {$+7\times {10}^{-16}$} times the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1--1.4 per year during the 2018--2019 observing run and 0.3--1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

@article{Peer_photospheric_non-thermal,
	Abstract = {A thermal radiative component is likely to accompany the first stages of the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and X-ray flashes (XRFs). We analyze the effect of such a component on the observable spectrum, assuming that the observable effects are due to a dissipation process occurring below or near the thermal photosphere. We consider both the internal shock model and a "slow heating" model as possible dissipation mechanisms. For comparable energy densities in the thermal and leptonic components, the dominant emission mechanism is Compton scattering. This leads to a nearly flat energy spectrum (ν F ν ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} ν 0 ) above the thermal peak at ≈10-100 keV and below 10-100 MeV, for a wide range of optical depths 0.03 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} τ γ e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 100, regardless of the details of the dissipation mechanism or the strength of the magnetic field. At lower energies steep slopes are expected, while above 100 MeV the spectrum depends on the details of the dissipation process. For higher values of the optical depth, a Wien peak is formed at 100 keV-1 MeV, and no higher energy component exists. For any value of τ γ e , the number of pairs produced does not exceed the baryon-related electrons by a factor of larger than a few. We conclude that dissipation near the thermal photosphere can naturally explain both the steep slopes observed at low energies and a flat spectrum above 10 keV, thus providing an alternative scenario to the optically thin synchrotron-SSC model.},

	Abstract = {We present a systematic spectral analysis of 350 bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE; ~30 keV-2 MeV) with high temporal and spectral resolution. Our sample was selected from the complete set of 2704 BATSE GRBs based on their energy fluence or peak photon flux values to assure good statistics and included 17 short GRBs. To obtain well-constrained spectral parameters, several photon models were used to fit each spectrum. We compared spectral parameters resulting from the fits using different models, and the spectral parameters that best represent each spectrum were statistically determined, taking into account the parameterization differences among the models. A thorough analysis was performed on 350 time-integrated and 8459 time-resolved burst spectra, and the effects of integration times in determining the spectral parameters were explored. Using the results, we studied correlations among spectral parameters and their evolution pattern within each burst. The resulting spectral catalog is the most comprehensive study of spectral properties of GRB prompt emission to date and is available electronically from the High-Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). The catalog provides reliable constraints on particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in GRBs.},

@article{amati_fit,
	Abstract = {We consider two empirical relations using data only from the prompt emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the peak energy ( E p )--peak luminosity ( L p ) relation (so called Yonetoku relation) and the E p --isotropic energy ( E iso ) relation (so called Amati relation). Both relations show high correlation degree, but they also have larger dispersion around the best fit function rather than the statistical uncertainty. Then we first investigated the correlation between the residuals of L p and E iso from the best function, and found that a partial linear correlation degree is quite small of ρ L p E iso ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/bdot.gif] {bold dot} E p = 0.379. This fact indicates that some kinds of independence may exist between Amati and Yonetoku relation even if they are characterized by the same physical quantity E p , and similar quantities L p and E iso which mean the brightness of the prompt emission. Therefore we may have to recognize two relations as the independent distance indicators. From this point of view, we compare constraints on cosmological parameters, Ω m and Ω Λ , using the Yonetoku and the Amati relation calibrated by low-redshift GRBs with z < 1.8. We found that they are different in 1-σ level, although they are still consistent in 2-σ level. In this paper, we introduce a luminosity time T L defined by T L ≡ E iso / L p as a hidden parameter to correct the large dispersion of the Yonetoku relation. A new relation is described as ( L p /10 52 erg s −1 ) = 10 −3.87$\pm$0.19 ( E p /keV) 1.82$\pm$0.08 ( T L /s) −0.34$\pm$0.09 . We succeeded in reducing the systematic error about 40% level, and might be regarded as ``Fundamental plane'' of GRBs. We show a possible radiation model for this new relation. Finally, applying the new relation to high-redshift GRBs with 1.8 < z < 5.6, we obtain (Ω m , Ω Λ ) = (0.17 +0.15 −0.08 , 1.21 +0.07 −0.61 ), which is consistent with the concordance cosmological model.},

@article{ramirez-ruiz_central_engine,
	Abstract = {GRB 990123 was a long, complex gamma-ray burst with an optical transient that started early within the gamma-ray phase. The peak and power-law decay of the early optical emission strongly indicate the presence of a decelerating relativistic shell during that phase. Prior to this burst, it was not known if the shell decelerated during the burst, so an external shock origin for the gamma rays was still possible. If the gamma rays are produced in the external shock, then the pulse widths should reflect the observed deceleration of the shell and increase by a factor between 1.25 and 2.3, depending on the angular extent of the shell. We analyze the fine time structure observed in the gamma-ray data from BATSE and determine that the width of the peaks does not increase as expected for a decelerating shell; the later pulses are only 1.034$\pm$0.035 longer than the earlier pulses. The lack of pulse width evolution eliminates the only remaining kinematically acceptable external shock explanation for the gamma-ray phase and, thus, the gamma rays must originate at a central engine.},

@article{best_fit_lu,
	Abstract = {We present a time-resolved spectral analysis of 51 long and 11 short bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed with the Fermi /Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, paying special attention to E p evolution within each burst. Among eight single-pulse long GRBs, five show an evolution from hard to soft, while three show intensity tracking. The multi-pulse long GRBs have more complicated patterns. Statistically, the hard-to-soft evolution pulses tend to be more asymmetric than the intensity-tracking ones, with a steeper rising wing than the falling wing. Short GRBs have E p tracking intensity exclusively with the 16 ms time-resolution analysis. We performed a simulation analysis and suggest that for at least some bursts, the late intensity-tracking pulses could be a consequence of overlapping hard-to-soft pulses. However, the fact that the intensity-tracking pattern exists in the first pulse of the multi-pulse long GRBs and some single-pulse GRBs, suggests that intensity tracking is an independent component, which may operate in some late pulses as well. For the GRBs with measured redshifts, we present a time-resolved E p -- L γ, iso correlation analysis and show that the scatter of the correlation is comparable to that of the global Amati/Yonetoku relation. We discuss the predictions of various radiation models regarding E p evolution, as well as the possibility of a precessing jet in GRBs. The data pose a great challenge to each of these models, and hold the key to unveiling the physics behind GRB prompt emission.},

MCRaT allows us to study explicitly the time evolution of the photosphere within the photospheric region, as well as the gradual decoupling of the photon and matter counterparts of the jet. The results of the radiation transfer simulations are also used to construct light curves and time-resolved spectra at various viewing angles, which are then used to make comparisons with observed data and outline the agreement and strain points between the photospheric model and long duration gamma-ray burst observations. We find that our fitted time-resolved spectral Band β parameters are in agreement with observations, even though we do not consider the effects of nonthermal particles. Finally, the results are found to be consistent with the Yonetoku correlation, but bear some strain with the Amati correlation.},

	Abstract = {We present a description of the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) implementation of the PLUTO code for solving the equations of classical and special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD and RMHD). The current release exploits, in addition to the static grid version of the code, the distributed infrastructure of the CHOMBO library for multidimensional parallel computations over block-structured, adaptively refined grids. We employ a conservative finite-volume approach where primary flow quantities are discretized at the cell center in a dimensionally unsplit fashion using the Corner Transport Upwind method. Time stepping relies on a characteristic tracing step where piecewise parabolic method, weighted essentially non-oscillatory, or slope-limited linear interpolation schemes can be handily adopted. A characteristic decomposition-free version of the scheme is also illustrated. The solenoidal condition of the magnetic field is enforced by augmenting the equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier providing propagation and damping of divergence errors through a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic explicit cleaning step. Among the novel features, we describe an extension of the scheme to include non-ideal dissipative processes, such as viscosity, resistivity, and anisotropic thermal conduction without operator splitting. Finally, we illustrate an efficient treatment of point-local, potentially stiff source terms over hierarchical nested grids by taking advantage of the adaptivity in time. Several multidimensional benchmarks and applications to problems of astrophysical relevance assess the potentiality of the AMR version of PLUTO in resolving flow features separated by large spatial and temporal disparities.},

The code provides a multiphysics, multialgorithm modular environment particularly oriented toward the treatment of astrophysical flows in presence of discontinuities. Different hydrodynamic modules and algorithms may be independently selected to properly describe Newtonian, relativistic, MHD, or relativistic MHD fluids. The modular structure exploits a general framework for integrating a system of conservation laws, built on modern Godunov-type shock-capturing schemes. Although a plethora of numerical methods has been successfully developed over the past two decades, the vast majority shares a common discretization recipe, involving three general steps: a piecewise polynomial reconstruction followed by the solution of Riemann problems at zone interfaces and a final evolution stage. We have checked and validated the code against several benchmarks available in literature. Test problems in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions are discussed.},

@article{morsony_variability,
	Abstract = {We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets propagating through their stellar progenitor material and subsequently through the surrounding circumstellar medium. We consider both jets that are injected with constant properties in the center of the star and jets injected with a variable luminosity. We show that the variability properties of the jet outside the star are a combination of the variability injected at the base of the jet and the variability caused by the jet propagation through the star. Comparing power spectra for the two cases shows that the variability injected by the engine is preserved even if the jet is heavily shocked inside the star. Such shocking produces additional variability at long timescales, of order several seconds. Within the limited number of progenitors and jets investigated, our findings suggest that the broad pulses of several seconds duration typically observed in GRBs are due to the interaction of the jet with the progenitor, while the short-timescale variability, characterized by fluctuations on timescales of milliseconds, has to be injected at the base of the jet. Studying the properties of the fast variability in GRBs may therefore provide clues to the nature of the inner engine and the mechanisms of energy extraction from it.},

@article{Belo_shocks,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the mechanism of internal shocks in opaque relativistic outflows, in particular in cosmological gamma-ray bursts. The shocks produce neutrino emission and affect the observed photospheric radiation from the explosion. They develop from internal compressive waves and can be of different types depending on the composition of the outflow. (1) Shocks in ``photon gas,'' with negligible plasma inertia, have a unique structure determined by the force-free condition---zero radiation flux in the plasma rest frame. Radiation dominance over plasma inertia suppresses the formation of collisionless shocks mediated by collective electromagnetic fields. (2) If the outflow is sufficiently magnetized, a strong collisionless subshock develops, which is embedded in a thicker radiation-mediated structure. (3) Waves in outflows with a free neutron component lead to dissipation through nuclear collisions. At large optical depths, shocks have a thickness comparable to the neutron free path, with embedded radiation-mediated and collisionless subshocks. The paper also presents first-principles simulations of magnetized flows filled with photons, demonstrating the formation of shocks and their structure. Simple estimates show that magnetized sub-photospheric shocks are efficient producers of photons and have a great impact on the observed photospheric radiation. The shock structure changes as the outflow expands toward its photosphere. The dissipation is accompanied by strong ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/838/2/125/apjaa5c8cieqn1.gif] {${e}^{\pm }$} pair creation, and the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/838/2/125/apjaa5c8cieqn2.gif] {${e}^{\pm }$} -dressed shock carries the photosphere with it up to two decades in radius, emitting a strong pulse of nonthermal radiation.},

@article{spectral_peak_belo,
	Abstract = {Observations indicate that the peak of a gamma-ray burst spectrum forms in the opaque region of an ultrarelativistic jet. Recent radiative transfer calculations support this picture and show that the spectral peak is inherited from initially thermal radiation, which is changed by heating into a broad photon distribution with a high-energy tail. We discuss the processes that regulate the observed position of the spectral peak E pk . The opaque jet has three radial zones: (1) the Planck zone r < R P where a blackbody spectrum is enforced; this zone ends where the Thomson optical depth decreases to τ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 10 5 , (2) the Wien zone R P < r < R W with a Kompaneets parameter y ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Gt.gif] {Gt} 1 where radiation has a Bose-Einstein spectrum, and (3) the Comptonization zone r > R W where the radiation spectrum develops a high-energy tail. Besides the initial jet temperature, an important factor regulating E pk is internal dissipation (of bulk motions and magnetic energy) at large distances from the central engine. Dissipation in the Planck zone reduces E pk , and dissipation in the Wien zone can increase E pk . In jets with subdominant magnetic fields, the predicted E pk varies around 1 MeV up to a maximum value of about 10 MeV. If the jet carries an energetically important magnetic field, E pk can be additionally increased by dissipation of magnetic energy. This increase is suggested by observations, which show E pk up to about 20 MeV. We also consider magnetically dominated jets; then a simple model of magnetic dissipation gives E pk ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 30 Γ W keV where Γ W is the jet Lorentz factor at the Wien radius R W .},

@article{Peer_fuzzy_photosphere,
	Abstract = {Propagation of photons in relativistically expanding plasma outflows characterized by steady Lorentz factor Γ is considered. Photons that are injected in regions of high optical depth are advected with the flow until they escape at the photosphere. Below the photosphere, the photons are coupled to the plasma via Compton scattering. I show here that as a result of the slight misalignment of the scattering electrons' velocity vectors, the (local) comoving photon energy decreases with radius as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsilon.gif] {epsilon} ' ( r ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/propto.gif] {propto} r −2/3 . This mechanism dominates the photon cooling in scenarios of faster adiabatic cooling of the electrons. I then show that the photospheric radius of a relativistically expanding plasma wind strongly depends on the angle to the line of sight, θ. For θ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} Γ −1 , the photospheric radius is θ-independent, while for θ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} Γ −1 , r ph (θ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/propto.gif] {propto} θ 2 . I show that the θ-dependence of the photosphere implies that for flow parameters characterizing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), thermal photons originating from below the photosphere can be observed up to tens of seconds following the inner engine activity decay. I calculate the probability density function P (r,θ) of a thermal photon to escape the plasma at radius r and angle θ. Using this function, I show that following the termination of the internal photon injection mechanism, the thermal flux decreases as F ob BB ( t ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/propto.gif] {propto} t −2 , and that the decay of the photon energy with radius results in a power-law decay of the observed temperature, T ob ( t ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/propto.gif] {propto} t −2/3 at early times, which changes to t −1/2 later.

@article{Woosley_Heger,
	Abstract = {Those massive stars that give rise to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) during their deaths must be endowed with an unusually large amount of angular momentum in their inner regions, 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the ones that make common pulsars. Yet the inclusion of mass loss and angular momentum transport by magnetic torques during the precollapse evolution is known to sap the core of the necessary rotation. Here we explore the evolution of very rapidly rotating massive stars, including stripped-down helium cores that might result from mergers or mass transfer in a binary, and single stars that rotate unusually rapidly on the main sequence. For the highest possible rotation rates (about 400 km s -1 ), a novel sort of evolution is encountered in which single stars mix completely on the main sequence, never becoming red giants. Such stars, essentially massive "blue stragglers," produce helium-oxygen cores that rotate unusually rapidly. Such stars might comprise roughly 1% of all stars above 10 M ☉ and can, under certain circumstances, retain enough angular momentum to make GRBs. Because this possibility is very sensitive to mass loss, GRBs are much more probable in regions of low metallicity.},

@article{lazzati_variable_photosphere,
	Abstract = {We numerically analyze the evolution of a long-duration gamma-ray burst jet as it leaves the progenitor star and propagates to the photospheric radius, where radiation can be released. We find that the interaction of the relativistic material with the progenitor star has influences well beyond the stellar surface. Tangential collimation shocks are observed throughout the jet evolution, out to about 100 stellar radii, which is the whole range of our simulation. We find that the jet is internally hot at the photospheric radius and we compute the photospheric emission. The photosphere is a very efficient radiator, capable of converting more than half of the total energy of the jet into radiation. We show that bright photospheres are a common feature of jets born inside massive progenitor stars and that this effect can explain the high radiative efficiency observed in long-duration bursts.},

@article{REES_MES_dissipative_photosphere,
	Abstract = {We consider dissipative effects occurring in the optically thick inner parts of the relativistic outflows producing gamma-ray bursts and X-ray flashes, emphasizing in particular the Comptonization of the thermal radiation flux that is advected from the base of the outflow. Such dissipative effects---e.g., from magnetic reconnection, neutron decay, or shocks would boost the energy density of the thermal radiation. The dissipation can lead to pair production, in which case the pairs create an effective photosphere farther out than the usual baryonic one. In a slow dissipation scenario, pair creation can be suppressed, and the effects are most important when dissipation occurs below the baryonic photosphere. In both cases an increased photospheric luminosity is obtained. We suggest that the spectral peak in gamma-ray bursts is essentially due to the Comptonized thermal component from the photosphere, where the comoving optical depth in the outflow falls to unity. Typical peak photon energies range between those of classical bursts and X-ray flashes. The relationship between the observed photon peak energy and the luminosity depends on the details of the dissipation, but under plausible assumptions can resemble the observed correlations.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a set of numerical simulations of long-duration gamma-ray burst jets associated with massive, compact stellar progenitors. The simulations extend to large radii and allow us to locate the region in which the peak frequency of the advected radiation is set before the radiation is released at the photosphere. Light curves and spectra are calculated for different viewing angles as well as different progenitor structures and jet properties. We find that the radiation released at the photosphere of matter-dominated jets is able to reproduce the observed Amati and energy-Lorentz factor correlations. Our simulations also predict a correlation between the burst energy and the radiative efficiency of the prompt phase, consistent with observations.},

@article{Atul,
	Abstract = {One of the most important unresolved issues in gamma-ray burst (GRB) physics is the origin of the prompt gamma-ray spectrum. Its general non-thermal character and the softness in the X-ray band remain unexplained. We tackle these issues by performing Monte Carlo simulations of radiation--matter interactions in a scattering dominated photon--lepton plasma. The plasma---initially in equilibrium---is driven to non-equilibrium conditions by a sudden energy injection in the lepton population, mimicking the effect of a shock wave or the dissipation of magnetic energy. Equilibrium restoration occurs due to an energy exchange between the photons and leptons. While the initial and final equilibrium spectra are thermal, the transitional photon spectra are characterized by non-thermal features such as power-law tails, high energy bumps, and multiple components. Such non-thermal features are observed at infinity if the dissipation occurs at small to moderate optical depths, and the spectrum is released before thermalization is complete. We model the synthetic spectra with a Band function and show that the resulting spectral parameters are similar to observations for a frequency range of 2--3 orders of magnitude around the peak. In addition, our model predicts correlations between the low-frequency photon index and the peak frequency as well as between the low- and high-frequency indices. We explore baryon and pair-dominated fireballs and reach the conclusion that baryonic fireballs are a better model for explaining the observed features of GRB spectra.},

@article{SSM_index_prob,
	Abstract = {The current scenario for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) involves internal shocks for the prompt GRB emission phase and external shocks for the afterglow phase. Assuming optically thin synchrotron emission from isotropically distributed energetic shocked electrons, GRB spectra observed with a low-energy power-law spectral index greater than - ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/581/2/1248/img1.gif] {img1.gif} (for positive photon number indices E α ) indicate a problem with this model. For spectra that do not violate this condition, additional tests of the shock model can be made by comparing the low- and high-energy spectral indices, on the basis of the model's assertion that synchrotron emission from a single power-law distribution of electrons is responsible for both the low-energy and the high-energy power-law portions of the spectra. We find in most cases that the inferred relationship between the two spectral indices of observed GRB spectra is inconsistent with the constraints from the simple optically thin synchrotron shock emission model. In this sense, the prompt burst phase is different from the afterglow phase, and this difference may be related to anisotropic distributions of particles or to their continual acceleration in shocks during the prompt phase.},

The new relation is derived by combining the data of E p and the peak luminosities by BeppoSAX and BATSE, and it looks considerably tighter and more reliable than the relations suggested by the previous works. Using the new E p -luminosity relation, we estimate redshifts of the 689 GRBs without known distances in the BATSE catalog and derive a GRB formation rate as a function of the redshift. For the redshift range of 0 ≤ z ≤ 2, the GRB formation rate increases and is well correlated with the star formation rate, while it keeps constant toward z ~ 12. We also discuss the luminosity function and the redshift dependence of the intrinsic luminosity (luminosity evolution).},
